A [sent](http://tools.suckless.org/sent/) fork for the browser.

Someone in the suckless mailinglist mentioned the problem of distributing sent
slides to other systems:

So here I am, the masochist that wrote this. Just not as static html generator
but in-browser Javascript application.

To use, just put the slides into a single element with id="slides" and load 
the script. The test directory shows the original sent example.
